# HideBattlegroundFinder
A Turtle WowW addon that automatically hides the Battleground finder minimap icon with - /script TWMiniMapBattlefieldFrame:Hide();
It doesn't play nicely with MinimapButtonBag, but is fine with MinimapButtonFrame.

Install location should be: ..\Interface\AddOns\HideBattlegroundFinder

**Make sure you remove the "-main" from the "HideBattlegroundFinder-main" folder so it becomes just "HideBattlegroundFinder"**
